# Harvard CS50 Projects Documentation

This repository contains my documentation and solutions for the [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) course. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, record my learning, and provide clear explanations of the projects and problem sets I have completed.

## Overview

CS50 is an introduction to computer science and programming. In this repository, you will find:

* Solutions to problem sets (PSets)
* Project implementations
* Notes and explanations of concepts learned
* Documentation of challenges and how I approached them

## Structure

The repository is organized by problem sets and projects:

```
/cs50
│
├── pset1/
├── pset2/
├── pset3/
└── final_project/
```

Each folder contains:

* Source code files
* README or documentation describing the solution
* Optional notes on key concepts or challenges

## Purpose

This repository is primarily for **documentation and learning purposes**. It helps me:

* Keep track of my progress
* Review solutions and approaches later
* Share my work with others in a structured way

## Notes

* Code is written in accordance with CS50 course guidelines.
* This repository is not intended for production use.
